          <h2 class="text-center">Tesla's Greatest Inventions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Alternating Current</strong></li>
            <p>an electric current that reverses its direction many times a second at regular intervals, typically used in power supplies.</p>
            <li><strong>Tesla Turbine</strong></li>
            <p>A Tesla turbine consists of a set of smooth disks, with nozzles applying a moving fluid to the edge of the disk. The fluid drags on the disk by means of viscosity and the adhesion of the surface layer of the fluid. As the fluid slows and adds energy to the disks, it spirals into the center exhaust. Since the rotor has no projections, it is very sturdy.</p>
            <li><strong>Tesla Coil</strong></li>
            <p>A Tesla coil is a radio frequency oscillator that drives an air-core double-tuned resonant transformer to produce high voltages at low currents. Tesla's original circuits as well as most modern coils use a simple spark gap to excite oscillations in the tuned transformer.</p>
            <li><strong>Radio</strong></li>
            <p>Nikola Tesla created a basic design for radio. On November 8, 1898 he patented a radio controlled robot-boat.  Tesla used this boat which was controlled by radio waves  in the Electrical Exhibition in 1898, Madison Square Garden.</p>
            <li><strong>Magnifying Transmitter</strong></li>
            <p>Tesla built the largest and most powerful Tesla Coil, called The Magnifying Transmitter. This had three coils and was 52 feet in diameter. What made it the biggest lightning at that time was the fact that it generated electricity of the order of millions of volts and shot lightning bolts (approximately 130 feet long).</p>
            <li><strong>Plasma Lamp</strong></li>
            <p>The plasma lamp was invented by Nikola Tesla after his experimentation with high-frequency currents in an evacuated glass tube for the purpose of studying high voltage phenomena, but the modern versions were known to be first designed by Bill Parker.</p>
            <li><strong>Shadowgraph</strong></li>
            <p>Tesla obtained images of a human body which he called shadowgraph. Also, Tesla experimented with reflected x-rays and described features of transmitted and reflected rays.</p>
            <li><strong>Power Plant Transformer House</strong></li>
            <p>Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse built the first hydro-electric power plant in  Niagara Falls 1895, thereby ensuring the beginning of electrification of the world.</p>
            <li><strong>Induction Motor</strong></li>
            <p>An induction motor is an AC electric motor in which the electric current in the rotor needed to produce torque is obtained by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding.</p>
